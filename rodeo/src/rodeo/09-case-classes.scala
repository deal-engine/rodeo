  /*
    Scala Case Classes are good for modeling immutable data. To define a Case Class we need to specify a constructor
    parameter list. These parameters are meant to define the most significant properties we want the objects of our
    class to have. Some of the benefits of using Case Classes are the following.

    1) An accessor method is generated for each parameter in the constructor.
    2) Case classes are easier to instantiate because  the `new` keyword in unnecessary. An
    `apply` method is generated on the companion-object which internally calls `new`.
    3) Case classes allows us to use pattern matching. An `unapply` method is generated on the
    companion-object which allows destructuring the fields that were used to build an instance.
    4) A copy method is automatically added on each instance that allows an easy way to modify part of an existing
    instance.
    5) `equals` methods and `hashCode` and other serializable methods are generated automatically for each instance,
    which means they can be used as keys on HashMaps

    When you instantiate a class by doing something like val Ana = Person("Ana", 34) you are implicitly thinking

    A companion Object to a class is an Object with the same name as the class and that is defined in the same file.
    An apply method defined inside a companion Object has an special meaning for the compiler.

    In order to recover the constructor parameters used to instantiate a class we need an unapply method.
    This method takes an instance of a class and returns an Option of the parameters used to construct this instance.
    It can be thought of as "wrapped" version of the inverse of apply.

    We do pattern matching by structurally matching the values with their constructors. In order to match those
    values, we need a way of asking the values used with the constructor. We do this by using the "unapply"
    method, which gives us the values inside the case class instance.
